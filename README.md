This version of DPPDiv includes a new fossil calibration model called the 'fossilized birth-death' (FBD) process.
(Work by Tracy Heath, John Huelsenbeck, and Tanja Stadler)

This version can also be used to estimate speciation, extinction and fossil recovery rates from stratigraphic range data under the constant rate FBD range process. (Work by Rachel Warnock, Tracy Heath, and Tanja Stadler)
